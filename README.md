# This is a small repository of information I found helpful along my journey to become the best engineer I can be. ✨

### Because I don't necessarily come from a computer science background, I became determined to try to fill the gaps where I can.  This list will grow/evolve as I get more in depth into the topics that interest me, but should hopefully serve as a good starting point for those (like me) who feel lost on where to even begin with the whole, "computer sciencey" thing.

### I know I'll probably miss some things, as some stuff I learned during bootcamp, and now I just "know" / remember, but over time I imagine things will come up where I need to refresh/re-review, and I'll put that in here.

## 📈 Data Structures and Algorithms 📈
### **Learning Platforms**:
- [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/):
  - I know the ads are sort of everywhere, and that it isn't cheap, but honestly, it is super helpful for someone who doesn't have
    the background knowledge of how data structures and algorithms even *remotely* relate to coding.  It gives a great overview of
    the fundamentals, exposes you to terms and the logic *behind* certain algorithms, and allows you to get a birds eye view of the
    patterns behind algorithmic complexities.
