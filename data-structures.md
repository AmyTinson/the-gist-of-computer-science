# Data Structures Intro
### Official Definition: Data structures are a collection of data values, the relationships between them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. 

### Software engineering, at its core, is manipulating data.  You take an input, manipulate it, and return it.  Data structures are a way to organize and/or manipulate data.

Problems can have multiple solutions.  Generally, you want to choose a solution with the best **space time complexity** for your use case.
- 👾Space Complexity: how much memory/space an algorithm uses
- ⏰Time Complexity: how fast an algorithm runs
- Space Complexity + Time Complexity = Space Time Complexity 👾⏰

Knowing the implications of **data structures** is key to choosing the best coding solutions!
